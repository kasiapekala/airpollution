# Air Pollution in Poland

Air Pollution analysis and Shiny web app were created as a part of a final project at the "Data engineering - Big Data Postgraduate Studies" in 2018.

It consisted of two parts:
- data preparation and analysis;
- Shiny application.

This repo contains code for data import, cleaning and historical pollution data analysis:
- Main code: data_import_and_quality_check.R.
- Code to install necessary packages: install_packages.R.
- Additional analysis: data analysis.R

Shiny app contains:
- A dashboard that shows current air quality,
- tools to review historical (2009-2016) pollution data.

The app is available here: https://pollution-analysis-pl.shinyapps.io/Zanieczyszczenia-PM25-w-Polsce/
